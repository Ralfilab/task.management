## Installation

See official docs for IIS hosting: https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/?view=aspnetcore-8.0

<a id="iis-hosting-windows"></a>
### IIS Hosting (Windows)
1. Install the default IIS role using Server Manager or PowerShell.
2. Install the ASP.NET Core hosting bundle (example release):
   - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-8.0.8-windows-hosting-bundle-installer
   - This ensures the correct .NET runtime, ANCM (ASP.NET Core Module), and other hosting components are present.
3. Configure your IIS site and app pool to use No Managed Code for ASP.NET Core apps and point the site to the published folder.

### SSL Certificate (win-acme)
- Use win-acme to request and install Let's Encrypt certificates on IIS:
  - https://www.win-acme.com/
- Typical workflow:
  1. Download win-acme and run it on the server.
  2. Follow the interactive prompts to select the IIS site and request a certificate.
  3. Ensure scheduled renewal and automatic binding to the site are configured.

## Integration tests (Playwright + .NET)

Playwright-based integration tests are executed with `dotnet test`. Use environment variables to enable Playwright debug behavior.

<a id="debug-mode"></a>
### Debug mode
- PowerShell:
  ```
  $env:PWDEBUG=1
  $env:HEADED="1"
  ```

### Run tests
- Run all tests:
  ```
  dotnet test
  ```

### Run a single test / filter
- To run a specific test, use its fully qualified name:
  ```
  dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~YourTestName"
  ```
- For category-based filtering, use:
  ```
  dotnet test --filter "Category=YourCategory"
  ```

### Notes
- Make sure Playwright browsers are installed for CI/agents using `playwright install` or the Playwright .NET tooling that performs browser install on first run.
- Use headful mode during debug; CI runs typically use headless mode (default) for speed.
